# React-Portfolio

This is a portfolio built using React. It showcases web development projects and provides sections for About Me, Portfolio, Contact, and Resume. This portfolio was created to demonstrate my skills and experience as a web developer, including React, routing with `react-router-dom`, form validation, and deployment to Netlify.

I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed React portfolio of work samples
